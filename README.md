### Titanic-survival-prediction-by-NN

This is my solution to the kaggle titanic data set problem.
Most of the work is shown in the titanic NN notebook. 
The notebook is divided into four section, for EDA analysis and applying machine learning algorithm.
I used different methods of sklearn, but the best result was from doing a 5 layer neural network that I learned from coursera.
to find a the best layers, I used a cross validation method.
